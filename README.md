## Installation

This package can be installed through a terminal using:

    pip install nasem_dairy

The environment that this is installed into will require
`python >= 3.10`. It will also install `pandas` and `numpy`
automatically.

The suggested way to install this is inside a virtual environment. For
example, by using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

1.  Open a terminal window, e.g., Anaconda Prompt.

2.  Create a new conda environment with Python installed:

        conda create --name myenvironment python>=3.10

        conda activate myenvironment

3.  Install this package via pip:

        pip install nasem_dairy

## Using the Model

### Import package

First, import `nasem_dairy`. `pandas` is also required if you want to modify the user_diet input.

``` python
import nasem_dairy as nd
import pandas as pd
```

### Get input data

There are several demo scenarios built into the app which can be used as input to the
model. These can be acessed using `nd.demo()`:

``` python
user_diet, animal_input, equation_selection, infusion_input = nd.demo("lactating_cow_test")
```
These 4 inputs can be modified to simulate different scenarios:
- user_diet (pd.DataFrame): The name and kg/d to feed for each ingredient in the diet.
- animal_input (dict): Parameters to descibe the animal being modelled. 
- equation_selection (dict): Select which equation to use when there are multiple options.
- infusion_input (dict): If simulating infusions specify this here. This is optional.

### Execute Model

To run the model use `nd.nasem` and pass the input data. This will return an instance of the nd.ModelOutput. 
Printing this will provide a snapshot of the results. 

``` python
## RUN MODEL ###
output = nd.nasem(
    user_diet = user_diet_in, 
    animal_input = animal_input_in, 
    equation_selection = equation_selection_in, 
    infusion_input = infusion_input)

print(output)
```

    Animal RDP intake g/d (An_RDPIn_g): 3556.058

    This is a `ModelOutput` object with methods to access all model outputs. See help(ModelOutput).


### Exploring the Results

The `nd.ModelOutput` class provides several methods to help you explore the results.

If you need a specific value you can used `get_value()`.

```python
Du_MiCP = output.get_value("Du_MiCP")
print(Du_MiCP)
```

    2.0524052134583415

If you don't know the exact name of the variable you can use the `search()` method.
For example if you want to see values related to microbial crude protein (MiCP) you
could search for "MiCP".

```python
print(output.search("MiCP"))
```

This will print a table with all the variables related to the search string and their value. 
The "Category" and "Level" columns show where the values are stored within ModelOutput. 
In this case "MiCP" is the name of a dictionary containg values related to microbial crude protein
production, so all values in this dictionary are displayed even if "MiCP" is not in the variable name.

The `nasem_dairy` package also includes all of the reports from the R version. These can be
accessed through the `get_report()` method by specifying the report name.

```python
print(output.get_report("table1_1"))
```

### The NASEM Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

`nasem_dairy` comes with an optional dag subpackage. This subpackage requires you install
the `graph-tool` package. This package has several requirements depending on your operating system.
For instructions on how to install visit their [website](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/installation.html)

This subpackage parses the equations used to build the NASEM model and uses the function arguments to 
build a DAG. This can then be used to explore how varaibles in the model are connected.

Once you have `graph-tool` installed you can create a DAG.

```python
dag = nd.ModelDAG()
```

Once you have created the DAG you can explore how functions are connected using `dag.get_calculation_order()`.

```python
dag.get_calculation_order("GrUter_Wt")
```

    Requirements for Calculating GrUter_Wt

    Order of Functions to Call:
    1. calculate_Uter_Wtpart
    2. calculate_Uter_Wt
    3. calculate_GrUter_Wtpart
    4. calculate_GrUter_Wt

    Required User Inputs:
    animal_input:
        - An_AgeDay
        - An_GestLength
        - An_Parity_rl
        - An_GestDay
        - Fet_BWbrth
        - An_LactDay

    Required Constants:
    coeff_dict:
        - GrUter_Ksyn
        - GrUterWt_FetBWbrth
        - Uter_KsynDecay
        - GrUter_KsynDecay
        - Uter_Ksyn
        - Uter_Kdeg
        - Uter_Wt_coeff
        - UterWt_FetBWbrth

This will display the functions that need to be called in order to calulate the specified value.
It also provides all of the input values that are involved in the calculation.

If you are only interested in calcualting a specific value you can use the `create_function()` method.
This will return a function that takes the required inputs and will call all of the functions
required to calculate the specified value. This returns a ModelOuptut just like the `nd.nasem()` function.

```
GrUter_Wt_function = dag.create_function("GrUter_Wt")
print(inspect.signature(GrUter_Wt_function))
```
    (animal_input, coeff_dict)

By inspecting the signature of the created function we see it requires animal_input and coeff_dict.
The animal_input can be the same as the one used to run `nd.nasem()`, though only the specified keys are required.
The coeff_dict contains default coefficients. The default can be accessed as `nd.coeff_dict`.
