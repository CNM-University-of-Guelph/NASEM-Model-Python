Notes for setting up quartodocs:

1) install quarto and make a new website 'project' inside the docs/ folder of package:
https://quarto.org/docs/websites/
- This will re-open a new 'project' window in VSCode, but can close and go back to package. It just sets up the minimum required files for a quarto website inside the docs/ folder

2) install quartodoc package: https://machow.github.io/quartodoc/get-started/overview.html

3) copy extra code to to the quarto.yml file to tell it how to make the docs

4) navigate terminal to the docs folder 
cd docs

5) run quartodoc build
This creates the markdown docs in a 'reference' folder inside docs/
If developing, use --watch so that quarto preview updates automatically too
quartodoc build --watch

6) run quarto preview / render as normal

Adding Interlinks:

Also need to run: 
quarto add machow/quartodoc

This allows interlinks to be used - linking between function names.
NOTE: should have run in docs/ dir. The _extensions folder that it creates needs to be in docs/ not root.
